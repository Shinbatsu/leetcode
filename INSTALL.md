## [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)

### Install via Stylus

1. If you havenâ€™t already installed Stylus, you can download it here: [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.htm)
2. Add the Dracula theme to the Stylus extension by copying the following CSS file: [Dracula-leetcode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dracula/leetcode/main/dracula_leetcode.user.css)

> [!NOTE]
> LeetCode has two themes. For a better experience, I recommend switching to the dark theme before applying these styles.
> The website may receive updates, and dark mode helps prevent any light spots from appearing.
